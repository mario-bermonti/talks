In this website you will find my talks on research methods, quantitative data analysis, and coding.

These talks are usually offered at my lab, my department, and similar forums.

The content is primarily focused on beginners or persons with limited knowledge on these topics.
Therefore, my main goal with these talks is to build basic knowledge about these topics,
build confidence, and get people working on these topics fast.
