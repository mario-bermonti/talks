## Agenda

- Why code?
- Objectives
- Why Mario offering this workshop?
- Setting up environment
- Basic test
- Hands-on coding
- Questions, feedback, next steps

## Why code?

- You can make the computer do what you want! 
- That is really, really cool! üòç
- That should be enough, but let's go deeper...
- Reproducibility
- Collaboration
- Automatize repetitive things
- Think more carefully about data
- Coding-based analysis has many more tools and options

## Objectives

- Feel confident that you can learn to analyze data using R
- Identify the basic concepts of R
- Use the posit cloud platform to run R code
- Identify quarto's basic functionality

## Why Mario?

- Cognitive and behavioral scientist
- Analyzes quantitative data daily
- Extensive experience using R, python, quarto, and other data analysis and programming tools
- Passionate about reproducibility and open science
- Passionate about software development
- Teaches data analysis and programming to graduate students

# Setting up the environment

## Create account
